# Laser Mayhem
## ***Status***
I’m no longer working on this project. It’s fully dropped and won’t be updated or refactored.
<br><br>
## ***Future work***
If I make another game, it will be a completely separate project (not a “cleaner” version of this).
<br><br>
## ***License & Reuse***
This repository is MIT-licensed. You’re free to fork, modify, and even build your own game using this concept.
<br><br>
## ***Maintenance / Support***
None. I won’t be reviewing issues or PRs. Forks are welcome—take it in whatever direction you want.
